Day 2: Operators

Tasks/Activities:

Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

Activity 2: Assignment Operators

â€¢ Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

Activity 3: Comparison Operators

â€¢Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

â€¢ Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

â€¢ Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

Activity 4: Logical Operators

â€¢ Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

Task 13: Write a program that uses the I operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

Activity 5: Ternary Operator

Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

Feature Request:

1. Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results. 2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the

results.

3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
